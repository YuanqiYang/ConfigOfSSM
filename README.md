# ConfigOfSSM
This Repository contains demo code for the ssm framework which is the reference for our final project.

The test directory is a simple project with the traditional ssm configuration. To run this program, make sure that you create a database
schema by running the sql file under src\main\resource\sql in your mysql workbench. Then configure your local tomcat and start this 
application. This application has 2 test url which are http://localhost:8080/user/showUser and http://localhost:8080/user/showAllUsers.
The first one will show information of the user whose is is 1, and the second url will show all user information in current database.

The ssmdemo directory is a demo project that integrate ssm framework with SpringBoot. We will talk more about this later.
